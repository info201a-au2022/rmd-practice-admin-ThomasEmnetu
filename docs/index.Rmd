## Covid Report

The total number of Covid-19 cases in the US is ```r get_total_cases()```. And, 
the total number of US deaths is ```r get_total_deaths()```.

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

There are no commas because the prettyNum() function is not used in the return statement for the
function getting the total number of deaths. You need to use this function to format the number since the numbers aren't formatted in the .csv `return(prettyNum(total_deaths,big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE))`  

I also want to show the chart:

```{r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
